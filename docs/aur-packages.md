Helpful AUR packages that I'm using:

- [VS Code (Microsoft)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/visual-studio-code-bin) [git](https://aur.archlinux.org/visual-studio-code-bin.git)
	- Apparently incompatible with Code
- [BCompare](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bcompare) [git](https://aur.archlinux.org/bcompare.git)
- [Figma Linux](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/figma-linux-bin) [git](https://aur.archlinux.org/figma-linux-bin.git)
	- Has intermittent problems. Might be better to just use the web app
- Nerd Fonts Jetbrains Mono [git](https://aur.archlinux.org/nerd-fonts-jetbrains-mono.git)
	- I'm not positive what happened to the AUR page for this one. Might have moved [here](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd/)?
	- Either way, just a nice font pack with ligatures
